	Audio Stealth System
	Menu cleanup
	Level iteration (grass?, maybe more *dawg*)
	Audio settings?
	Shaders?

- DONE:
	Maybe make the dogs get faster over time during chase?
		Right now the player outruns the dogs, so they aren't a huge
		threat all of the time.
	Tighten up movement (ice skates)
	Lamp posts dont have collision...
	Level iteration: bushes
		Bushes have no collision for player, but collision for dog detection ray
			so player can hide in a bush!
